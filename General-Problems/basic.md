Set 1: Writing number and string variables with built-in methods

# 1 Write a program that uses a variable to store a number, then prints that number plus 10.

# 2 Write a program that uses a variable to store a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# 3 Write a program that uses variables to store two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# 4 Write a program that uses a variable to store a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# 5 Write a program that uses a variable to store a number, then prints the number times 10.

# 6 Write a program that uses variables to store two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# 7 Write a program that uses a variable to store a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# 8 Write a program that uses a variable to store a number with decimals, then prints the number as an integer.

# 9 Write a program that uses a variable to store two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# 10 Write a program that uses a variable to store a word, then prints the word with all lowercase letters.

Personal Builds below, add to practice sessions at leisure

# SP1 Take two words and store them using one line to two different variables. Replace all vowels with 
# $ signs and print the words in both uppercase and lowercase. 



Set 2: Write if statements with valid syntax

# 1 Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

# 2 Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

# 3 Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.

 # 4 Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 9 if the number is less than 10, prints 19 if the number is less than 20, prints 29 if the number is less than 30, and prints -1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

 # 5 Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1 if the number is over 9000, and prints -1 otherwise

 # 6 Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 100 if either number is greater than 10, and prints -100 otherwise.

 # 7 Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1776 if the number is less than 0, and prints 1979 otherwise.

 # 8 Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 100 if the number equals 100, prints 99 if the number is equal to 99, and prints 0 otherwise.

 # 9 Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the first number is less than zero and the second number is greater than 0, and prints 0 otherwise.

 # 10 Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 5 if the number is greater than 80, prints 4 if the number is greater than 60, prints 3 if the number is greater than 40, prints 2 if the number is greater than 20, and prints 1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).


 Set 3 Write a loop which modifies a variable each time the loop runs. 

# 1 Write a while loop to print the numbers 1 through 10.

# 2 Write a while loop that prints the word "hello" 5 times.

# 3 Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters the word "stop".

# 4 Write a while loop that prints the numbers 0 through 100, increasing by 5 each time.

# 5 Write a while loop that prints the number 9000 ten times.

# 6 Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a number and will run forever until the user enters a number greater than 10.

# 7 Write a while loop that prints the numbers 50 to 70.

# 8 Write a while loop that prints the phrase "Around the world" 144 times.

# 9 Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters a word with more than 5 letters.

# 10 Write a while loop that prints the even numbers from 2 to 40.
