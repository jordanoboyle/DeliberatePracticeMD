Free to use for anyone who desire problems to practice the repetitive nature of coding. 
Credit to Actualize Bootcamp for the idea. 

Mission: 
I plan to expand this with different directories and templates to answer various questions. 
This will be a long process and likely never to be fully completed. There will be a mix of 
mark downs, text files, different language files, html templates, css templates, etc. 

Markdown and textfiles will have the challenges lined up and numbered.
All credit will be issued at site of challenge if it isn't from Actualize,
which is credited here. 

Current Complete Builds in General Problems
Basic        - general questions that will be good for any language. 
Intermediate - general questions that will be good for any language.
Advanced     - general questions that will be good for any language.

Guide: These should  be easy to copy and paste into any text editor and then be commented out for reference to the challenge. Personally, for shorter problems I keep the answers all in the same file as the questions and just comment them out to keep clutter to a minimum in the console. 
For larger questions that require more space I do single files. How you choose to operate here is up to you. I have the challenge .md file in the folder where my practice files are for easy reference.
