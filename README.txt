Mission: 
I plan to expand this with different directories and templates to answer various questions. 
This will be a long process and likely never to be fully completed. There will be a mix of 
mark downs, text files, different language files, html templates, css templates, etc. 

Markdown and textfiles will have the challenges lined up and numbered.
All credit will be issued at site of challenge if it isn't from Actualize,

Current Complete Builds in General Problems
Basic        - general questions that will be good for any language. 
Intermediate - general questions that will be good for any language.
Advanced     - general questions that will be good for any language.

Guide: These should  be easy to copy and paste into any text editor and then be commented out for reference to the challenge. Personally, for shorter problems I keep the answers all in the same file as the questions and just comment them out to keep clutter to a minimum in the console. 
For larger questions that require more space I do single files. How you choose to operate here is up to you. I have the challenge .md file in the folder where my practice files are for easy reference. 

WhiteBoard Challenges:
These are potential problems that should be worked together with at least one other person, though that should not stop you from doing them on your own. 
Generally these are done on a whiteboard or in a text editor with plain text so as not to affect a proper IDE from interpreting the code. 

I would suggest trying the problems in an actually IDE like text editor before shifting to the more cumbersome standard text editor where none of the extra features work. The standard editor is meant to mimic a white board in most cases. 

Make an effort to solve the problems the long way. Ideally do not use methods like .sort, .reverse or similar (we know you can use those). Find a way to mimic their abilities without using them. 

Currently there are two levels:
Standard: 
  - Contains Intermediate-Technical file
Bonus:
  - Contains More-Technical File
