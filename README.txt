Free to use for anyone who desire problems to practice the repetitive nature of coding. 
Credit where credit is due, I got the idea from Actualize Programming School. 

Mission: 
I plan to expand this with different directories and templates to answer various questions. 
This will be a long process and likely never to be fully completed. There will be a mix of 
mark downs, text files, different language files, html templates, css templates, etc. 

Markdown and textfiles will have the challenges lined up and numbered.
All credit will be issued at site of challenge if it isn't from Actualize,
which is credited here.
