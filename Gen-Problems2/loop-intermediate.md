# SET 2: ANOTHER SET OF INTERMEDIATE LOOP CHALLENGES. ANY LANGUAGE CAN BE USED. 
# IDEALLY YOU SOLVE THESE USING LOOPS AS DEFINED IN THE DESCRIPTION. (USE ANY LOOP TYPE DESIRED)

1: Reverse a String: Write a program that takes a string as input and outputs the string in reverse order. For example, if the input is "hello", the output should be "olleh".

2: Count Characters: Write a program that takes a string as input and counts the number of occurrences of each character in the string. Output the counts for each character.

3: Even or Odd Sum: Write a program that calculates the sum of all even or odd numbers from 1 to a given positive integer n, based on user input. For example, if the user chooses to sum even numbers and n is 5, the output should be 6 (2 + 4).

4: Pascal's Triangle: Write a program that generates the first n rows of Pascal's triangle. Each number in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row.

5: Armstrong Numbers: Write a program that identifies all Armstrong numbers between 1 and a given positive integer n. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
