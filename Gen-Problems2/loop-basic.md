# SET 1: LOOP PROBLEM SET THAT CAN BE SOLVED ANY WAY DESIRED. THESE SHOULD BETWEEN BASIC AND INTERMEDIATE
# DEPENDING ON THE LANGUAGE, DIFFERENT LOOP TYPES CAN BE USED IN ORDER TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. 


1: Sum of Numbers: Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given positive integer n.

2: Factorial: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer n. The factorial of n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

3: Fibonacci Sequence: Write a program that generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

4: Multiplication Table: Write a program that generates the multiplication table for a given integer n. The table should display the products of n multiplied by each integer from 1 to 10.

5: Prime Numbers: Write a program that determines whether a given integer n is a prime number. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.
