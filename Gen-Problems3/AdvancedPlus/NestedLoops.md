1. Use a nested loop to convert an array of objects with nested objects into a flat array of values.
Example: [{a: {b: 1}}, {a: {b: 2}}, {a: {b: 3}}] becomes [1, 2, 3].

2. Find the largest product of any two different numbers within a given 2D array.
Example: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] becomes 30.

3. Use a nested loop to calculate the sum of all pairs of numbers within a 2D array.
Example: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] becomes 21.

4. Convert a nested hash into a flat array with each combination of keys and values.
Example: {"a": {"b": 1, "c": 2}, "d": {"e": 3, "f": 4}} becomes ["a.b", 1, "a.c", 2, "d.e", 3, "d.f", 4].

5. Find the smallest product of any two different numbers within a given array.
Example: [5, -2, 1, -9, -7, 2, 6] becomes -63.

6. Use a nested loop to create a hash with the sum of each combination of numbers from two arrays as keys.
Example: [1, 2] and [3, 4] becomes {4: [1, 3], 5: [1, 4, 2, 3], 6: [2, 4]}.

7. Convert a 2D array of numbers into a flat array with every combination of products.
Example: [[2, 3], [4, 5]] becomes [8, 10, 12, 15].

8. Use a nested loop to create a new hash with the product of values from two hashes.
Example: {a: 2, b: 3} and {x: 4, y: 5} becomes {ax: 8, ay: 10, bx: 12, by: 15}.

9. Create a nested array of hashes from two arrays of objects based on matching keys.
Example: [{id: 1, name: "Alice"}, {id: 2, name: "Bob"}] and [{id: 1, age: 25}, {id: 2, age: 30}] becomes [{id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 25}, {id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 30}].

10. Use a nested loop to compute the difference of each pair of numbers from two arrays of objects.
Example: [{id: 1, value: 3}, {id: 2, value: 7}] and [{id: 3, value: 2}, {id: 4, value: 5}] becomes [1, -2, 5, 2].
