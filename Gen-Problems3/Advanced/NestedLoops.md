1. Convert an array of objects into a flat array of values for a specific key.
Example: [{a: 1, b: 2}, {a: 3, b: 4}, {a: 5, b: 6}] for key a becomes [1, 3, 5].

2. Find the intersection of two arrays of objects based on a specific key.
Example: [{id: 1}, {id: 2}, {id: 3}] and [{id: 2}, {id: 3}, {id: 4}] for key id becomes [{id: 2}, {id: 3}].

3. Use a nested loop to count the frequency of each pair of numbers in a 2D array.
Example: [[1, 2], [1, 2], [3, 4], [2, 3]] becomes { "1,2": 2, "3,4": 1, "2,3": 1 }.

4. Convert an array of objects into a nested object using multiple keys.
Example: [{continent: "Asia", country: "Japan", city: "Tokyo"}, {continent: "Asia", country: "China", city: "Beijing"}] becomes {Asia: {Japan: ["Tokyo"], China: ["Beijing"]}}.

5. Use a nested loop to calculate the difference of each pair of numbers in two arrays.
Example: [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6] becomes [3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3].

6. Find the largest sum of any two different numbers within a given array.
Example: [5, -2, 1, -9, -7, 2, 6] becomes 11.

7. Convert an array of hashes into a hash with nested arrays.
Example: [{name: "A", value: 1}, {name: "B", value: 2}, {name: "A", value: 3}] becomes {A: [1, 3], B: [2]}.

8. Create a new array by multiplying each combination of numbers from two arrays using a nested loop.
Example: [1, 2] and [3, 4] becomes [3, 4, 6, 8].

9. Use a nested loop to create an array of objects from two arrays.
Example: ["name", "age"] and ["Alice", 25, "Bob", 30] becomes [ {name: "Alice", age: 25}, {name: "Bob", age: 30} ].

10. Create a new array by concatenating strings from two arrays with a nested loop.
Example: ["a", "b"] and ["c", "d"] becomes ["ac", "ad", "bc", "bd"].
